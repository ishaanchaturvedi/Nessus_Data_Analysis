remote host is prior to 2.2.12. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - A heap-based buffer underwrite flaw exists in the
    function 'apr_strmatch_precompile()' in the bundled copy
    of the APR-util library, which could be triggered when
    parsing configuration data to crash the daemon.
    (CVE-2009-0023)

  - A flaw in the mod_proxy_ajp module in version 2.2.11
    only may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
    response data intended for a client that sent an
    earlier POST request with no request body.
    (CVE-2009-1191)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

  - There is an off-by-one overflow in the function
    'apr_brigade_vprintf()' in the bundled copy of the
    APR-util library in the way it handles a variable list
    of arguments, which could be leveraged on big-endian
    platforms to perform information disclosure or denial
    of service attacks. (CVE-2009-1956)

  - Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist
    in Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of SMBv1 packets. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities, via a
    specially crafted SMBv1 packet, to disclose sensitive

  - Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in
    Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of requests. An unauthenticated,

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP running on the remote web
server is 7.0.x prior to 7.0.9. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - A man-in-the-middle vulnerability exists, known as
    'httpoxy', due to a failure to properly resolve
    namespace conflicts in accordance with RFC 3875 section
    4.1.18. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is set based
    on untrusted user data in the 'Proxy' header of HTTP
    requests. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is used by
    some web client libraries to specify a remote proxy
    server. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted 'Proxy' header in an HTTP request,
    to redirect an application's internal HTTP traffic to an
    arbitrary proxy server where it may be observed or
    manipulated. (CVE-2016-5385)

  - An overflow condition exists in the php_bz2iop_read()
    function within file ext/bz2/bz2.c due to improper
    handling of error conditions. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, via a crafted request, to
    execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5399)

  - A flaw exists in the GD Graphics Library (libgd),
    specifically in the gdImageScaleTwoPass() function
    within file gd_interpolation.c, due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service condition. (CVE-2016-6207)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the
    virtual_file_ex() function within file
    Zend/zend_virtual_cwd.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition
    or the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6289)

  - A use-after-free error exists within the file
    ext/session/session.c when handling 'var_hash'
    destruction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to deference already freed memory,
    resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    deference already freed memory, resulting in the
    execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6295)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the
    simplestring_addn() function within file simplestring.c
    due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or the execution of
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6296)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the
    php_stream_zip_opener() function within file

    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this

OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2i. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2i. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server.","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.2i or later.

following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate

    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server.","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.2i or later.

Note that the GOST ciphersuites vulnerability is not yet fixed by the
vendor in an official release; however, a patch for the issue has been
committed to the OpenSSL github repository.","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt

20007.0,,7.1,High,10.0.236.31,tcp,3071.0,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.","https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-ssl.pdf

40467.0,CVE-2009-0023,7.8,High,10.0.254.151,tcp,80.0,Apache 2.2.x < 2.2.12 Multiple Vulnerabilities,The remote web server may be affected by several issues.,"According to its banner, the version of Apache 2.2.x. running on the
remote host is prior to 2.2.12. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - A heap-based buffer underwrite flaw exists in the
    function 'apr_strmatch_precompile()' in the bundled copy
    of the APR-util library, which could be triggered when
    parsing configuration data to crash the daemon.
    (CVE-2009-0023)

  - A flaw in the mod_proxy_ajp module in version 2.2.11
    only may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
    response data intended for a client that sent an
    earlier POST request with no request body.
    (CVE-2009-1191)

  - The server does not limit the use of directives in a
    .htaccess file as expected based on directives such
    as 'AllowOverride' and 'Options' in the configuration
    file, which could enable a local user to bypass
    security restrictions. (CVE-2009-1195)

  - Failure to properly handle an amount of streamed data
    that exceeds the Content-Length value allows a remote
    attacker to force a proxy process to consume CPU time
    indefinitely when mod_proxy is used in a reverse proxy
    configuration. (CVE-2009-1890)

  - Failure of mod_deflate to stop compressing a file when
    the associated network connection is closed may allow a
    remote attacker to consume large amounts of CPU if
    there is a large (>10 MB) file available that has
    mod_deflate enabled. (CVE-2009-1891)

  - Using a specially crafted XML document with a large
    number of nested entities, a remote attacker may be
    able to consume an excessive amount of memory due to
    a flaw in the bundled expat XML parser used by the
    mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (CVE-2009-1955)

  - There is an off-by-one overflow in the function
    'apr_brigade_vprintf()' in the bundled copy of the
    APR-util library in the way it handles a variable list
    of arguments, which could be leveraged on big-endian
    platforms to perform information disclosure or denial
    of service attacks. (CVE-2009-1956)

response header and did not try to check for the issues themselves or
even whether the affected modules are in use.","Upgrade to Apache version 2.2.12 or later. Alternatively, ensure that

host is 2.2.x prior to 2.2.33-dev or 2.4.x prior to 2.4.26. It is,
therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to
    third-party modules using the ap_get_basic_auth_pw()
    function outside of the authentication phase. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    bypass authentication requirements. (CVE-2017-3167)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists due to
    third-party module calls to the mod_ssl
    ap_hook_process_connection() function during an HTTP
    request to an HTTPS port. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service
    condition. (CVE-2017-3169)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in mod_http2 that
    is triggered when handling a specially crafted HTTP/2
    request. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this to cause a denial of service condition. Note that
    this vulnerability does not affect 2.2.x.
    (CVE-2017-7659)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the
    ap_find_token() function due to improper handling of
    header sequences. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this, via a specially crafted header
    sequence, to cause a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2017-7668)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in mod_mime due to
    improper handling of Content-Type response headers. An

enabled. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist
    in Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of SMBv1 packets. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities, via a
    specially crafted SMBv1 packet, to disclose sensitive
    information. (CVE-2017-0267, CVE-2017-0268,

    CVE-2017-0275, CVE-2017-0276)

  - Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in
    Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of requests. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities, via a
    specially crafted SMB request, to cause the system to
    stop responding. (CVE-2017-0269, CVE-2017-0273,

  - Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in
    Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of SMBv1 packets. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities, via a
    specially crafted SMBv1 packet, to execute arbitrary

    consumed. (CVE-2014-3506)

  - A memory leak error exists in 'd1_both.c' related to
    handling specially crafted DTLS packets that allows
    denial of service attacks. (CVE-2014-3507)

  - An error exists in the 'OBJ_obj2txt' function when
    various 'X509_name_*' pretty printing functions are
    used, which leak process stack data, resulting in an
    information disclosure. (CVE-2014-3508)

  - An error exists related to 'ec point format extension'
    handling and multithreaded clients that allows freed
    memory to be overwritten during a resumed session.

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP running on the remote web
server is 7.0.x prior to 7.0.9. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - A man-in-the-middle vulnerability exists, known as
    'httpoxy', due to a failure to properly resolve
    namespace conflicts in accordance with RFC 3875 section
    4.1.18. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is set based
    on untrusted user data in the 'Proxy' header of HTTP
    requests. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is used by
    some web client libraries to specify a remote proxy
    server. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted 'Proxy' header in an HTTP request,
    to redirect an application's internal HTTP traffic to an
    arbitrary proxy server where it may be observed or
    manipulated. (CVE-2016-5385)

  - An overflow condition exists in the php_bz2iop_read()
    function within file ext/bz2/bz2.c due to improper
    handling of error conditions. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, via a crafted request, to
    execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5399)

  - A flaw exists in the GD Graphics Library (libgd),
    specifically in the gdImageScaleTwoPass() function
    within file gd_interpolation.c, due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service condition. (CVE-2016-6207)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the
    virtual_file_ex() function within file
    Zend/zend_virtual_cwd.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition
    or the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6289)

  - A use-after-free error exists within the file
    ext/session/session.c when handling 'var_hash'
    destruction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to deference already freed memory,
    resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6290)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the
    exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE() function within file
    ext/exif/exif.c. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service condition or
    disclose memory contents. (CVE-2016-6291)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    exif_process_user_comment() function within file
    ext/exif/exif.c. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service condition.

    remote attacker can exploit these to cause a denial of
    service condition or disclose memory contents.
    (CVE-2016-6293, CVE-2016-6294)

  - A use-after-free error exists within file
    ext/snmp/snmp.c when handling garbage collection during
    deserialization of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    deference already freed memory, resulting in the
    execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6295)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the
    simplestring_addn() function within file simplestring.c
    due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or the execution of
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6296)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the
    php_stream_zip_opener() function within file
    ext/zip/zip_stream.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling zip streams. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or the execution of
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6297)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the GD Graphics
    Library (libgd), specifically in the
    gdImageScaleBilinearPalette() function within file
    gd_interpolation.c, when handling transparent color. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or disclose
    memory contents.

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the
    mdecrypt_generic() function within file
    ext/mcrypt/mcrypt.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition
    or the execution of arbitrary code.

  - A flaw exists in the curl_unescape() function within
    file ext/curl/interface.c when handling string lengths.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause heap corruption, resulting in a denial of service
    condition.

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the
    mcrypt_generic() function within file
    ext/mcrypt/mcrypt.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition
    or the execution of arbitrary code.

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP running on the remote web
server is 7.0.x prior to 7.0.9. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - A man-in-the-middle vulnerability exists, known as
    'httpoxy', due to a failure to properly resolve
    namespace conflicts in accordance with RFC 3875 section
    4.1.18. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is set based
    on untrusted user data in the 'Proxy' header of HTTP
    requests. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is used by
    some web client libraries to specify a remote proxy
    server. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted 'Proxy' header in an HTTP request,
    to redirect an application's internal HTTP traffic to an
    arbitrary proxy server where it may be observed or
    manipulated. (CVE-2016-5385)

  - An overflow condition exists in the php_bz2iop_read()
    function within file ext/bz2/bz2.c due to improper
    handling of error conditions. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, via a crafted request, to
    execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5399)

  - A flaw exists in the GD Graphics Library (libgd),
    specifically in the gdImageScaleTwoPass() function
    within file gd_interpolation.c, due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of
    service condition. (CVE-2016-6207)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the
    virtual_file_ex() function within file
    Zend/zend_virtual_cwd.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition
    or the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6289)

  - A use-after-free error exists within the file
    ext/session/session.c when handling 'var_hash'
    destruction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to deference already freed memory,
    resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6290)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the
    exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE() function within file
    ext/exif/exif.c. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service condition or
    disclose memory contents. (CVE-2016-6291)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    exif_process_user_comment() function within file
    ext/exif/exif.c. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service condition.

  - Multiple out-of-bounds read errors exist in the
    locale_accept_from_http() function within file
    ext/intl/locale/locale_methods.c. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit these to cause a denial of
    service condition or disclose memory contents.
    (CVE-2016-6293, CVE-2016-6294)

  - A use-after-free error exists within file
    ext/snmp/snmp.c when handling garbage collection during
    deserialization of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    deference already freed memory, resulting in the
    execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6295)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the
    simplestring_addn() function within file simplestring.c
    due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or the execution of
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6296)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the
    php_stream_zip_opener() function within file
    ext/zip/zip_stream.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling zip streams. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or the execution of
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6297)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the GD Graphics
    Library (libgd), specifically in the
    gdImageScaleBilinearPalette() function within file
    gd_interpolation.c, when handling transparent color. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service condition or disclose
    memory contents.

  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the
    mdecrypt_generic() function within file
    ext/mcrypt/mcrypt.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition
    or the execution of arbitrary code.

  - A flaw exists in the curl_unescape() function within
    file ext/curl/interface.c when handling string lengths.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause heap corruption, resulting in a denial of service
    condition.

    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.

    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this

    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.

    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of

OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2i. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate

OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2i. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server.","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.2i or later.

    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES
    and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit
    block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    who has sufficient resources can exploit this
    vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
    collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret
    and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the
    secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly
    resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.
    (CVE-2016-2183)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate
    the server.","Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.0.2i or later.

Note that the GOST ciphersuites vulnerability is not yet fixed by the
vendor in an official release; however, a patch for the issue has been
committed to the OpenSSL github repository.","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt

20007.0,,7.1,High,10.0.236.31,tcp,3071.0,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.","https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-ssl.pdf

20007.0,,7.1,High,10.0.237.11,tcp,49169.0,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
